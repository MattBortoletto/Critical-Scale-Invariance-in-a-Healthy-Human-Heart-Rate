## Abstract 
In this work we want to analyse from a physics perspective the time series of human heart rate to show that there is a robust scale-invariance in PDF of detrended healthy human heart rate increments. Moreover, we want to show that such increments are not Gaussian distributed, but they display fat tails. This scale-indipendent and fractal structure, together with other multifractal scaling properties and with long-range temporal correlation support the view that a healthy human heart rate is controlled to converge continually to a critical state.
